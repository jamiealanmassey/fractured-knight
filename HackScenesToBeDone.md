# Hack scene:
We have a small list of Scenes that need to be created for the hack. They are the following:

## Main Scene - last thing to do
Here we need the main scene to where we will attach all the worlds. Fot our case just the firsts but we will need to have a few "to-be-made" worlds that we we can later add.   

## Player - Jamie
Has movement, collsion and animations. There should be a blank journal when you click on the player.
The inventory system i say we dont include that now but do that for the next version.

## World - Nathen / vikram
1 world, 5 rooms. Each room will have its own scene therfor 5 scenes are required. Atrifacts, 3 items to be scatteded accorss the 5 rooms. Each room must be diffrent. 
world -> room -> items
Items: these can be anything like artifacts,

I sugggest we get started on the game as soon as and not be scared to ask for help. Also **unit Tests** will need to be completed and logged (more on that later).

**Good luck!**

PS: more will come soon.....
