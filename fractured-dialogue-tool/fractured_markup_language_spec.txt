FML TOKENS/COMMANDS
-{ write[label]                      }- outputs a line of text to a valid context (this could be a console or UI) 
-{ branch[action1, action2, action3] }- indicates branching with a list of labels and should be followed by the appropriate number of branches
-{ locate[label]                     }- moves the dialogue context to the line with the corresponding label; the reserved label 'end' will close the context immediately
-{ trigger[message]                  }- emits a message from the dialogue context to any component that is listening with the specified message
-{ set[symbol]                       }- stores the symbol in memory to be used like a trigger, this is saved/loaded in the gamestate and should be persistent
-{ unset[symbol]                     }- removes the symbol from memory, this is saved/loaded in the gamestate and should be persistent
-{ evaluate[symbol]                  }- evaluates if a symbol exists and if it does the indented context is executed
-{ #                                 }- denotes a comment, the rest of the line after this token is discarded

A SIMPLE FML DIALOGUE EXMAPLE
write[location0] Hello there fellow adventurer!
write[location1] Beware for these paths are treacherous!

A BRANCHING FML DIALOGUE EXAMPLE
write[introduction0] Good day traveler.
write[introduction1] You must watch yourself in these parts.
branch[I heed your advice, You don't scare me!]
    write[heed0] Good! You would be wise to do so.
    write[heed1] Go forth and tread carefully.
    trigger[unlock_door] # Feeding this back into Godot could allow us to unlock a door and resume progression

    write[scare0] It is foolish of you to ignore my warning! # Spaces indicate separation of branches
    write[scare1] Turn back now, you are not prepared for this journey.
    trigger[block_door] # Feeding this back into Godot could allow us to lock a door and pause progression

evaluate[block_door]
    write[door0] You hear a click and a sinking feeling floods you
    locate[end] # Close the dialogue early

write[farewell0] Farewell traveller, until next time!
write[farewell1] Oh, and one last piece of advice, it's dangerous to go alone.
